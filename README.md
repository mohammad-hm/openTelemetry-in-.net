# openTelemetry-in-.net
working with opentelemetry in dotnet

in this project we use opentelemetry(metrics and traces), and config program.cs to export data

to console and otel collector, and also add a yaml file for config otel collector

actully we get metrics and traces and export to otel collector and otel export them to prometheus and jaeger and so we can see metrics and traces in graphana
